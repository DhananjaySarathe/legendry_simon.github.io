Game Rules

Rule 1: Carefully watch the box which blinks and remember the sequence in which it was blinking

Rule 2: Press the boxes in order according to the instruction indicated above(whether it is "same sequence" or "reverse sequence").

Rule 3: Each time you properly press the boxes in correct order, one more button will automatically blinks and again you have to repeat the same steps as indicated in above rules.

For example : When you will select the level, the game will start. Let's suppose red button will blink in first time. So you have to click on red button. Now blue button blinks in second time. Then we will have either of the two conditions :
1. Same sequence-> If same sequence then first click on red button and then blue one.
2. Reverse sequence-> If reverse sequence then first click on blue button and then red one, i.e. in reverse order.
                        and the game will continue like that.
                        
Rember: As you'll increase the level, difficulty level will also increase so the sequence may be alternate i.e. one time same sequence next time reverse or vice verse and the so on.
Also in legendry mode the boxes can also shuffle within themselves so also keep that in mind.
